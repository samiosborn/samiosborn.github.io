## Career

I'm currently a Senior Investment Associate at Bootstrap Europe, where I invest in startups across deep-tech (biotech, robotics, and AI). My work includes financial forecasting, portfolio simulation, returns analysis, founder networking, and presenting investment recomendations.

Prior to this, I worked as an Investment Banking Analyst at Barclays advising companies in climate technology. During this time, I built deep expertise in valuation, financial modelling, and competitive landscape analysis.

## Education

I studied **Mathematics (BSc)** and **Finance (MSc)** at Imperial College London, graduating in 2019 and 2020 respectively. 

## Projects

Outside of investing, I'm passionate about robotics, machine learning, and learning through building projects. 

## Personal

Currently I live in London, and enjoy sports including cycling and powerlifting.
